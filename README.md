# oop_project
This is a project intended for refreshing C++ syntax and OOP/

I intended to create a project where I use most of the C++ functionalities in order to refresh myself in the language and get familiar with new concepts.
With this project, users can either be administrators or buyers.
- Administrators can do things such as adding, removing, renaming items.
- Users can buy items and browse them


Some concepts used in this project are:
- OOP concepts such as:
-- Polymorphism
-- Inheritance
-- Abstraction
-- Encapsulation
- State machine ( in order to capture which state the user is in and present the relevant information )
- Dictionaries ( In order to keep an inventory and add or remove items from it )
- Pointers
- Etc..
